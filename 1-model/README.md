# ðŸ§  Model

## Purpose

This stage focuses on gaining a clear understanding of the environment and potential threats through asset identification, topology mapping, and threat modeling. It aligns with MITRE D3FEND's 'Model' category, where defenders build situational awareness to inform future defensive strategies.

## Folder Layout

- `README.md`: Overview of this category and tools used
- `scripts/`: General-purpose automation and utilities (Shell scripts, PowerShell, Python, etc.)
- `custom/`: My own created tools or configurations (original or heavily adapted tools/configs I've built or forked)
- `tools.md`: Links and descriptions of open-source tools

## Expected Contents

- Network maps and architecture diagrams
- Asset discovery scripts (e.g., Nmap, NetBox dumps)
- Threat modeling tools or STRIDE diagrams
- Topology documentation and enumeration utilities
