# üõ°Ô∏è Harden

## Purpose

Hardening involves proactively securing systems and software to reduce the attack surface. In D3FEND, this includes configuration management, privilege restriction, patching, and endpoint protection. This category builds the defensive baseline for all hosts and services.

## Folder Layout

- `README.md`: Overview of this category and tools used
- `scripts/`: General-purpose automation and utilities (Shell scripts, PowerShell, Python, etc.)
- `custom/`: My own created tools or configurations (original or heavily adapted tools/configs I've built or forked)
- `tools.md`: Links and descriptions of open-source tools

## Expected Contents

- OS and software hardening scripts (e.g., CIS Benchmarks)
- Configuration management files
- Audit tools like Lynis, OpenSCAP
- Local firewall and privilege restriction policies
