# ðŸŽ­ Deceive

## Purpose

Deception increases adversary cost and visibility by planting traps (honeypots, honeytokens) and monitoring their interaction. It corresponds to D3FEND's adversary engagement and misdirection techniques.

## Folder Layout

## Expected Contents

- Honeypot deployment scripts (Cowrie, T-Pot, OpenCanary)
