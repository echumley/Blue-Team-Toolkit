# ðŸ§° Miscellaneous

## Purpose

This category includes general tools, glue code, experimental ideas, and supporting resources that don't fit directly into the MITRE D3FEND framework. It serves as a flexible space for utility scripts, cross-category integrations, training materials, and documentation.

## Folder Layout

- `README.md`: Overview of this category and tools used
- `scripts/`: General-purpose automation and utilities (Shell scripts, PowerShell, Python, etc.)
- `custom/`: My own created tools or configurations (original or heavily adapted tools/configs I've built or forked)
- `tools.md`: Links and descriptions of open-source tools

## Expected Contents

- Setup scripts for the toolkit (e.g., `build_toolkit_env.sh`)
- Cheatsheets and quick reference guides
- Utility scripts and log processing tools
- Experimental tools or blue team PoCs
- API wrappers and third-party integrations (e.g., VirusTotal, OTX)
- Training content, blue team labs, or practice ranges
