# 🧰 Blue Team Toolkit

This repository is a toolkit of blue team tools, commands, scripts, and utilities for use in CTFs, labs, and real-world blue team operations.

The structure mirrors the [MITRE D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/) framework, with each directory corresponding to a specific category of defensive action. Each category contains curated tools, open-source utilities, and custom-built resources created by me to assist defenders in that area.
